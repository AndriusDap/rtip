It is housed in the elegant setting of Somerset House, one of the city's most dynamic cultural venues. The Courtauld Gallery is renowned for its unrivalled Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, including masterpieces by Monet, Van Gogh and Gauguin and the largest collection of Cézannes in the UK. It houses a major collection of Old Master paintings and is one of the few museums in the country to display such a rich selection of early twentieth-century art. The Gallery also holds an outstanding collection of drawings and prints and fine works of sculpture and decorative arts.\n\nThe Courtauld Gallery regularly presents major exhibitions and special displays which are consistently acclaimed for their outstanding quality and originality.\n\n\"One of the world's great collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art\"\n- The Guardian\n\n",

We pass iconic sites including The Shard, Borough Market, Tate Modern and St.Paul's before following in the footsteps of Shakespeare & Dickens to explore hidden backstreets and quirky history en-route to London's last galleried coaching inn, only Art Nouveau pub, an infamous literary den and a grand Victorian gin palace.\n\nWe believe small really is beautiful, so the group size is never more than 12 clients creating a friendly & relaxed atmosphere whilst also being able to reach parts of the city that other tours just can't reach. A historic day out guaranteed!\n\nN.B. Participants must be over 18yrs of age.",

        "description": "The Foundling Museum explores the history of the Foundling Hospital, the UK’s first children’s charity and first public art gallery.\n\nThe Foundling Hospital, which continues today as the children’s charity Coram, was established in 1739 by the philanthropist Thomas Coram to care for babies at risk of abandonment. Instrumental in helping Coram realise his vision were the artist William Hogarth and the composer George Frideric Handel. Through a dynamic programme of exhibitions and events the Museum celebrates the ways in which artists of all disciplines have helped improve children’s lives for over 275 years.\n\nThe moving story of the Hospital and the children who grew up there is revealed through the artworks, objects and archival documents on display in the Museum. The Museum also holds the Gerald Coke Handel Collection, an internationally-important collection of material relating to Handel and his contemporaries. ",

        "description": "Kings, queens, statesmen and soldiers; poets, priests, heroes and villains - Westminster Abbey is a must-see living pageant of British history. The Abbey is steeped in more than a thousand years of history and every year we welcome over one million visitors who want to explore this 700-year-old building.\n\nWestminster Abbey has been the Coronation Church since 1066 and is the final resting place of 17 monarchs. The present church, begun by Henry III in 1245, is one of the most important Gothic buildings in the country, with the medieval shrine of an Anglo-Saxon saint still at its heart. Visitors to the Abbey can see the Coronation Chair, where all but two of Britain's monarchs have been crowned, Poets' corner, the burial place of writers, playwrights and poets, and the outstanding 14th-century Lady Chapel. Once inside free audio guides are available or there is the highly-popular verger-led tour.\n\nOn Sundays and religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas, the Abbey is open for worship only. \n\nPlease note, the 2FOR1 offer is not valid 20 Jul to 1 Sep 2016",

Here you can find everything from the glory days of scarlet and gold to the mud and blood of two devastating world wars tracing the dangerous role of present day soldiering in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nThe collection boasts a large number of artefacts that belonged to members of the Royal Family, many of whom served in The Guards. There is also an inspiring exhibition of Victoria Crosses won by Guardsmen since it was first awarded 153 years ago as well as numerous other gallantry awards.",

        "description": "Situated just a 40 minute train ride from Waterloo, award winning Strawberry Hill is Britain's finest example of Gothic Revival architecture and interior decoration. It began life in 1698 as a modest house and was transformed by Horace Walpole, the son of England's first Prime Minister into a \"little gothic castle\".\n\nReopened to the public in 2010 after a L9 million restoration, today's visitors have the opportunity to explore this unique heritage site. With the aid of a guide book written by Horace himself, visitors can revel in the award-winning, extensive restoration of the interiors and contemplate the unique collection of Renaissance painted glass that magically light up the rooms.\n\nEnthusiastic visitors of all ages are invited to enjoy the theatrical experience of touring Strawberry Hill and participate in our packed 2016 calendar of events which will undoubtedly make for an unforgettable experience at Walpole's magical castle.",

Guarding the official entrance to the Royal Residences, the Household Cavalry mounts The Queen’s Life Guards here daily in ceremonies broadly unchanged since the days of Charles II over 350 years ago- unique British pageantry at its very best.\n\nMuseum visitors learn of the remarkable history and traditions of the regiment and its modern role as an armoured reconnaissance force deployed in conflict zones worldwide. The experience is brought to life with superb graphics and interactive displays. The dazzling arrays of uniforms, weapons and rare exhibits compliment the compelling personal stories of many of the heroes of this elite fighting unit.\n\nA multimedia touchscreen guide is offered to visitors free of charge.",

Visitors will experience a hands-on educational experience allowing them to handle original artefacts, including torture devices, as well as the opportunity to view and hear the amazing stories of the inmates and the notorious Southbank.\n\nOwned by the Bishop of Winchester, The Clink Prison was used to control the Southbank of London known as \"The Liberty of The Clink\". This area housed much of London's entertainment establishments including four theatres, bull-baiting, bear-baiting, inns and many other darker entertainments.",

The collection embraces tiny musical boxes, reproducing pianos, orchestrions, residence organs and violin players. A star exhibit is the \"Mighty Wurlitzer\" cinema organ which rises up from beneath the stage to entertain visitors as it did in the \"Golden Age\" of cinema.\n\nDiscover how music was captured and instruments powered and experience the actions and sounds of self-playing instruments. Specialist, volunteer, guides demonstrate instruments at weekends and on selected days each week.\n\nThe Riverview Tea Room opens on Sundays and offers a range of light refreshments. There is a concert hall that seats over 200 people and a shop featuring a range of musically themed gifts. Special events take place throughout the year and include a monthly Tea Dance on Saturday afternoons with the Wurlitzer organ.",

        "description": "Discover one of London’s best historic house museums in picturesque Hampstead. The Freud Museum was the final home of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, who came here with his family in 1938 after fleeing Nazi-occupied Vienna. Visit Freud’s London home to see his intriguing study, preserved just as it was during his lifetime. Here, among the book-lined walls, you will find his original iconic, psychoanalytic couch. \n\nThe house also contains Freud’s remarkable collection of antiquities: Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Oriental. Almost 2,000 items fill cabinets and are arranged on every surface, including on the desk where Freud wrote until the early hours of the morning. The Museum is also filled with memories of his daughter, Anna, a pioneer of child psychoanalysis. \n\nOur 2016 exhibitions programme includes Turner Prize winning artist Mark Wallinger (13 July – 25 September).  Visit, take in an exhibition, browse the gift shop and enjoy Freud’s garden.",

Imagine the Globe as it would have been: the centre of what was once London's most notorious entertainment district, surrounded by raucous taverns and bawdy-houses.\n\nThe Exhibition audio guide, developed in conjunction with Acoustiguide, included in the standard admission price and available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Mandarin and Japanese.\n\nOur expert guides will take you on a fascinating tour of the iconic Globe Theatre, bringing the space to life with colourful stories of the 1599 Globe, of the reconstruction process in the 1990s, and of how the 'wooden O' works today as an imaginative and experimental theatrical space.\n\nTours begin every 30 minutes, and are in English.",

Learn about the cargos and people who strove to make a living on the canals, and the horses that pulled the boats. See inside a narrowboat cabin, work a boat through a model lock and peer down into a huge Victorian ice well.\n\nThe museum is housed in an attractive canalside building that was built in the mid-19th century as an ice warehouse. Meet the horse and see her reconstructed stable and the horseramp up the inside of the building.\n\nDownload our MP3 tour or find out about our exciting events programme from our website before you come!",

        "description": "Dulwich Picture Gallery is the World's first purpose-built public art gallery, founded in 1811 and designed by Regency architect Sir John Soane. It houses one of the finest collections of Old Masters in England, especially rich in French, Italian and Spanish Baroque paintings and in British portraits from the Tudor period to the 19th century. The Gallery's permanent collection is complemented by its diverse and critically acclaimed year round temporary exhibitions.\n\nFor over a quarter of a century Dulwich Picture Gallery's award-winning learning and community engagement programmes have reached beyond the Gallery's exhibition programme to bring art to the South London community through outreach initiatives.",

        "description": "The flamboyant Henry VIII is most associated with this majestic palace, which he extended and developed after acquiring it from Cardinal Wolsey in the 1520s. He lavished money on fabulous tapestries and paintings, housed and fed a huge court and pursued a succession of wives, political power and domination over Rome.\n\nThe Tudor buildings that remain are among the most important in existence, but the elegance and romance of the palace owe much to the baroque buildings commissioned by William III and Mary II at the end of the 17th century. The palace is surrounded by formal gardens and acres of parkland with deer that are descendants of the herd once hunted by Henry VIII.\n\nNew from Spring 2016, your kids can run riot in the new Magic Garden, where they can climb a Tudor tower and even ride a fire-breathing dragon, before disappearing into the garden maze.",

It was home to the astronomer and musician William Herschel and his sister Caroline.\n\nFeatures include Herschel’s workshop, his music room and a charming formal garden where, with a telescope of his own construction, Herschel discovered the planet Uranus in 1781.

We'll send you a voucher by email, with instructions on how to redeem it. When you use the offer, you'll also need to show a GWR train ticket (or proof of travel on a GWR train) from the previous 7 days.\n\nOffer details: Terms and conditions\n\nnot to be used in conjunction with any other offers\nopening times: week days 13:00 to 17:00 (last entry 16:15).

It was designed by Inigo Jones for James I, and work finished in 1622.\n\nIntended for the splendour and exuberance of court masques, the Banqueting House is probably most famous for one real life drama: the execution of Charles I which took place here in 1649 to the 'dismal, universal groan' of the crowd. One of Charles's last sights as he walked through the Banqueting House to his death was the magnificent ceiling, painted by Peter Paul Rubens in 1630-34.\n\nFree admission for children under 16.",

Come aboard the world's sole surviving tea clipper and experience what life at sea was really like.\n\n\"What a fabulous experience! The ship's restoration has been magnificent. Seeing the copper-clad hull from below is truly extraordinary. I loved the interactive displays below decks - they kept the kids occupied for nearly an hour and they learned a lot as they went. Keeping everything \"as is\" above decks gives a real sense of what it would have been like to ship out 150 years ago.\" Visitor feedback left on Cutty Sark Facebook page.",

        "description": "BOND IN MOTION, the largest official collection of original James Bond vehicles anywhere in the world, is now presenting a new display called The Cars of SPECTRE at the London Film Museum, Covent Garden.\n\nIn the main exhibition space the numerous vehicles on display include the archetypal Bond car, the Aston Martin DB5, Goldfinger's majestic Rolls-Royce Phantom III and the unforgettable Lotus Esprit S1 submersible from The Spy Who Loved Me. These are displayed alongside less predictable 007 modes of transport such as the Citroën 2CV and the Crocodile Submarine and the exhibition also includes a variety of aircraft, boats and motorcycles.\n\nThere are no replicas - every vehicle exhibited is an original as seen on screen.\n\nThe upper mezzanine features several examples of the creative process of the production company's art department - never-before-seen concept art and storyboards.\n\nBond In Motion displays both the adrenalin-pumping high performance machinery and the unique 007 defining inventions that are essential to the continuing James Bond story.",

Our production pays homage to this history and notably to the knights of Portsoken, a group of 13 knights to whom 10th century King, Edgar the Peaceful, gifted the very land upon which the banquet sits in recognition of performing three acts of bravery and each evening during the banquet our knights assemble to preserve the history of this ancient rite with an elaborate display of sword fighting.\n\n40 years of banquets - 1000 years of history.",

        "description": "Ancient stones reverberate with dark secrets, priceless jewels glint in fortified vaults and pampered ravens strut the grounds. The Tower of London is a 1,000-year-old castle that protects the Crown Jewels. It was a royal palace, a fortress and an infamous prison, and today it’s one of Britain's most visited historic sites.\n\nDespite a grim reputation as a place of torture and death, there are many more stories to be told about the Tower which even housed a menagerie! An intriguing cast of characters have played their part, including the dastardly jewel-thief Colonel Blood, tragic Lady Jane Grey and maverick zoo keeper Alfred Cops.\n\nJoin in as the Tower comes alive with re-enactments from its evocative past, and see if you can spot our famous winged inhabitants, the ravens. Legend has it that Charles II believed that if the ravens were ever to leave the Tower, the fortress and the kingdom would fall.\n\nAdmission price includes voluntary donation of £2.50.\n\nPlease note, the 2FOR1 offer is not valid from 16 July to 4 September 2016",

Travel beyond Earth to encounter the most remote realms of our Solar System.\n\nLayers of data from NASA and ESA (European Space Agency) space missions have been merged with the art of photography to create visually arresting images of planets, moons, comets, asteroids and the Sun as the human eye would see them.\n\nExplore the exhibition with a special audio guide narrated by space scientist Dr. Joe Michalski. Joe will take you through the exhibition, discussing the photographs with a number of experts, detailing how they relate to research carried out at the Museum into the early formation of the Earth, how the Solar System first began and what life is like on other planets.",

They can meet the friendly animals up close, try out activities such as face-painting, badge-making and mask-making, or join the keepers at feeding times. They’ll have great fun in the playgrounds, exploring the sandpits, rides and life-sized tractor and fire engine.\n\nIn the Barley Mow Farm they can say hello to Kune Kune pigs Wiggle and Piggle, to the donkeys, rabbits and guinea pigs or to Shetland pony Feather. Emus Ant and Dec are enormous fun to watch, along with the cheeky Asian short-clawed otters and mischievous monkeys.\n\nThere’s a secret lookout tunnel for spying on the meerkats and plenty more animals to see, including ring-tailed lemurs, wallabies, Scottish wildcats, agouti, chinchillas, cotton top tamarins, chipmunks, gerbils, harvest mice, giant African land snails, snakes, turtles, parrots, doves, finches and lovebirds.  Keeper Experiences are new for 2016, so see the website for details. ",

The little princess who grew up here endured a stifling and often lonely existence, but as an adult, Queen Victoria always spoke fondly of her birthplace.\n\nThe famous Orangery was built in 1704 for Queen Anne, and George II's wife Queen Caroline, another keen gardener, added further improvements. Today the gardens reconnect the palace and the landscape once more.\n\nDon’t miss Fashion Rules Restyled, with new dress from the collections of HM The Queen, Princess Margaret and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n**Offer not valid between 16 July - 4 September 2016**",

Samuel Johnson, the writer and wit, lived and worked here in the middle of the eighteenth century, compiling his great Dictionary of the English Language in the Garret.\n\n Today, the House is open to the public with a collection relating to Johnson. Often described by visitors as a hidden gem, 17 Gough Square is a tranquil spot in the midst of the bustling City and offers visitors a research library with regular exhibits, restored interiors and a wealth of original features, including unique panelled doors, an open staircase and even Georgian anti-burglary devices! You can explore how life was for Johnson and his housemates in this 'difficult and noisy household' while experiencing Georgian fashion with our authentic adults' and children's costumes.\n\nAudio guide, Foreign interpretation (10 languages), DVD and Gift shop.",

        "description": "The Jewel Tower dates back over 700 years and is an intriguing visitor attraction in the heart of Westminster. It was built around 1365 to house Edward III's treasures and was known as the 'King's Privy Wardrobe'. One of only two buildings from the medieval Palace of Westminster to survive the fire of 1834, the tower features a 14th-century ribbed vault.\n\nAcross all three floors, the story of Jewel Tower's history and changing role over the centuries is told. Features include a model of the 'lost' medieval palace of Westminster, replicas of precious objects and areas of set dressing including an 18th-century clerk's office.\n\nWhy not make a visit to the Jewel Tower part of your day out in central London?",

Designed by Sir Christopher Wren and Dr Robert Hooke, and completed in 1677, this colossal column commemorates the City which rose from the ashes.\nEvery year over 230,000 visitors climb the 311 spiral steps to The Monument's observation gallery, 160 feet (48.7 metres) above the ground,  to enjoy unique and exhilarating views of the capital. The 360 degree views available allow visitors to take in the spectacular panoramas of London past and present. \n\nMajor restoration work costing £4.5 million was completed in 2010, a task which is only undertaken every 100 years. The Monument has a new lease of life and has emerged revitalized; come andenjoy it afresh.",

Traditional afternoon teas are served on Tuesday and Sunday from 3pm (booking advised).\n\nThe Museum holds fan-making workshops on the first Saturday of each month (places limited to six attendees).

The walk complements the Changing the Guard Tour as we will see all those other 'must dos' like Westminster Abbey, The Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square and the unforgettable Change of the Lifeguard at Horseguards Parade.\n\nThis is a particularly fine tour if you are in London for a short period of time, and would like to leave with an understanding of the most prominent sites. Crucially, as with all our tours, our experienced, personable and passionate Guide is keen to ensure your tour is hugely enjoyable as well as informative.",

        "description": "St Paul's is not only an architectural masterpiece and its dome a landmark of the London skyline, but also a symbol of the hope, resilience and strength of the city and nation it serves. A cathedral has stood here since 604 AD with the present cathedral having been built between 1675-1710 after the Great Fire of London destroyed its predecessor in 1666.\n\nIts rich and diverse history means there is lots for visitors to the cathedral to discover on the cathedral floor, the crypt and the galleries; experience the acoustic quirks of the Whispering Gallery and breathtaking panoramic views from the Golden Gallery.\n\nThe crypt is the resting place for many famous Britons such as Lord Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, and the cathedral's architect himself - Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nVisitors can explore using a touch-screen multimedia guide; join a guided tour; and watch the award winning 270° film experience, Oculus - an eye into St Paul's.\n\nVisitors may view the new video art installation 'Martyrs' by American artist Bill Viola. Additionally there is a new exhibition of a unique altar frontal, made for the national service of thanksgiving held at St Paul's at the end of WW1. It is accompanied by stories about some of the 138 servicemen who embroidered it whilst recovering from injuries sustained during the Great War.",

It was originally commissioned as a grand outer entrance to Buckingham Palace and moved to its present site in 1882.\n\nFor glorious panoramas over London's Royal Parks and the Houses of Parliament, take the lift to the balconies just below the spectacular bronze sculpture surmounting the arch. The balconies also offer unique views of the Household Cavalry, passing beneath to and from the Changing of the Guard at Horse Guards Parade.\n\nIn addition to a new exhibition about the history of Wellington Arch, the London landmark now houses an additional exhibition space - The Quadriga Gallery. The gallery hosts a series of fast-changing exhibitions exploring the history and heritage of England.\n\nThe property may close at short notice, please call in advance for details.\n\nPlease note, the 2FOR1 offer is not valid on Bank Holidays or event days.
